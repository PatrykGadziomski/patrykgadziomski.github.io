                Well, to be honest you don't gave to learn how to code. It's not neccassary for
                living. You can live your common boring life also without it. But if you learn it
                (and maybe you actuall yhvae to, because youre writing an exam on it next week), you'll
                be able to build everything. And I literally mean EVERYTHING!
                <br>
                With programming you can not also automate every boring task on your pc but also be
                creative. You can build games, webites, software, databasea, etc. and even artifixial intelligence!
                Yeah you've heared right, that's the thing everybody is talking about like... daily (It's really annoying
                to be honest...). And if you're become a true engineer, you could also biuld serious network comunication
                pipelines or program a robot. I mean it. But thats some future music we hear here right now. Let's
                focus on the bascics, so one day you can build you little freaky dream.
