            <p>Python Tutorial: #0 - Welcome</p>
            <h1>Welcome to my Python Tutorial!</h1>
            <h2>Ready to see the world of programming with whole new eyes?</h2>
            <h3>You're a librarian? Great! Let's be friends!</h3>
            <h4>Anyway, let's start!</h4>
            <br>
            <p>
                In this tutorial you'll be learning Python. Python is a popular
                programming language, mostly used in the field of data-related tasks.
                But that's not limited to it. You can do a lot with Python, from data
                science to game development. I will try to cover as many areas as possible,
                but will focus on the basics in the beginning, before we start with the fun stuff.

                This tutorial is built as a simple HTML blog, where you switch between the pages.
                There is no fancy gamification (this is not Duolingo) or any progress tracker. Track 
                it by yourself. This is more like the place you go when you ask yourself: 
                "Oh man. How do I use a for-loop again?" See yourself in it? Perfect! You're in the right place.
                Below you'll see links to different parts of this tutorial. Feel free to skip parts you
                already know. But beware: you'll also skip all of my brilliant jokes, hidden mysteriously and perfectly
                aligned in the tutorial content. It's your choice...
